In this repository, I show scenarios of way the common and different design pattern are approached to solve real life "problems". 
The design patterns included are strategy, builder, observer, iterator and finally builder. 

It is to be known that these scenarios could be coded further. These are meant to be simple to show the interaction between 
parent and child classes and the dependency between the classes and the usefulness of interfaces.
