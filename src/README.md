In this repository, I show scenarios of way the common and different design pattern are approached to solve real life "problems". 
The design patterns are within categories: 

Creational:
- Factory: In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client. 
- Abstract Factory: Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories. This factory is also called as factory of factories. In Abstract Factory pattern an interface is responsible for creating a factory of related objects without explicitly specifying their classes. Each generated factory can give the objects as per the Factory pattern.
- Builder
- Singleton 


Behavioral:
- Command 
- Iterator
- Strategy 
- Visitor 
- Observer 

Structural:
- Composite 
- Facade

# Java Design Patterns:
This repository includes: 
### - Builder
### - Factory 
### - Iterator
### - Observer
### - Strategy

I use these common design patterns to solve real life "problems". It is to be known that these scenarios could be coded further. These are meant to be simple to show the interaction between parent and child classes and the dependency between the classes and the usefulness of interfaces.
