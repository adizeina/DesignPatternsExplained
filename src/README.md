In this repository, I show scenarios of way the common and different design pattern are approached to solve real life "problems". 
The design patterns are within categories: 

Creational:
- Factory: In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client. 
- Abstract Factory: Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories. This factory is also called as factory of factories. In Abstract Factory pattern an interface is responsible for creating a factory of related objects without explicitly specifying their classes. Each generated factory can give the objects as per the Factory pattern.
- Builder
- Singleton 


Behavioral:
- Command 
- Iterator
- Strategy 
- Visitor 
- Observer 

Structural:
- Composite 
- Facade
